## Overview

SpartanBytes is a powerful file synchronization tool designed to help you keep your files organized and up-to-date across multiple devices. With its advanced features and customizable settings, SpartanBytes ensures that your data moves efficiently to your desired backup location.

### 🔧 Features:

- Sync only certain file types, sizes, or files matching complex logic.
- Maintain a database (e.g., SQLite) of synced files for traceability.
- Automatically organize files into subfolders (e.g., by date, type, metadata).
- Rename files using custom logic (slugify, hashes, timestamps, etc.).
- Throttle syncing based on system load, disk space, or time of day.
- Use deduplication, compression, or integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256 validation).

### 🔐 Security:

- Enforce per-path policies (no syncing .env, *.bak, or certain extensions).
- Audit every sync operation and produce signed logs (for legal/regulatory use).

### 📡 Reactive / Event-Driven File Sync

- Use notify crate (inotify on Linux) to watch the file system and sync instantly when a file is created/changed.
- Useful when you want real-time behavior, not polling.

### 🧠 Smart Policies / AI / Heuristics

- Automatically decide when and what to sync (e.g., based on ML model, user history, etc.).
- Detect "duplicate-but-not-quite" files.
- Pre-process files before syncing (e.g., compress large videos, resize images).

### 📊 User-Facing Dashboard / CLI / API

- Provide a web UI or REST API for managing/scheduling syncs.
- Integrate into a larger backup/archiving system.
- Build a TUI with ratatui for terminal-based control.
